## Pre-requisites

Unlike most folks these days, I am a huge believer in "memorizing as much as possible." What's cooler when people come to your desk with a question? 
You googling the answer or you answering it without googling?

There is a great book called "The Memory Book." You should read it. It tells you all kind of tricks on how to memorize.

## Mastering Your Keyboard

I've been sitting in front of computer for years, but never really tried to improve my typing skills. If you are like me, you can type alphabets with no problem,
but when it gets to typing in numbers or werid symbols or single/double quotation marks, you have to look at the keyboard. I want you to master touchtyping. It's
one less thing to worry about when you are in the zone. Worrying about keys quickly gets you out of the zone. And there are some good sites to help you do that.

Just a couple of tips.

1. Never use multiple fingers to push the same key.
2. Always use the opposite side `shift` key for uppercases.
3. This is how I memorize number keys and symbols on top. `1 looks like ! 2 kinda looks like @ 3 pounds is equivalent 4 dollars which is equivalent to 5 percent and 6 is wearing a hat(^) 7 and(&) snowing(*) is falling on snowman(8)'s head`
