## Pre-requisites and my babblings

Unlike most folks these days, I am a huge believer in "memorizing as much as possible." What's cooler when people come to your desk with a question? 
You googling the answer or you answering it without googling? Which scenario do you think people would walk away thinking you know your stuff?

If you don't save anything in your head, are you really a smart person? For me, memorizing means I am planting seeds in my brain. And those seeds grow and grow. 
And I can think about those while I am walking my dog or driving to work. I can go through html tags from top to bottom. I can design a page in my head putting tags
together in my head. Then it snowballs. Then ideas come. It's possible because I have things in my head.

There is a great book called "[The Memory Book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0345410025)." You should read it. It tells you all kind of tricks on how to memorize.

## Mastering Your Keyboard

I've been sitting in front of computer for years, but never really tried to improve my typing skills. If you are like me, you can type alphabets with no problem,
but when it gets to typing in numbers or werid symbols or single/double quotation marks, you have to look at the keyboard. I want you to master touchtyping. It's
one less thing to worry about when you are in the zone. Worrying about keys quickly gets you out of the zone. And there are some good sites to help you do that.

Just a couple of tips.

1. Never use multiple fingers to push the same key.
2. Always use the opposite side `shift` key for uppercases.
3. This is how I memorize number keys and symbols on top. `1 looks like ! 2 kinda looks like @ 3 pounds is equivalent 4 dollars which is equivalent to 5 percent and 6 is wearing a hat(^) 7 and(&) snowing(*) is falling on snowman(8)'s head`
4. Buy a good mechanical keyboard and carry that around with you, so that your fingers get comfortable with the keyboard.

## Mastering Your Editor(Vim)

I encourge you to learn vim. Why that ancient thinig? Because it's the best editor that's packaged into any unix based cloud instance you will spin up. Currently
my vim level is a baby level. But I am working on improving it. And mastery of vim has prerequisite of mastering touch typing.

Learning vi is like learning a new language. The more I learn vim, the more I am awed by it. Such a beautifully designed piece of software.

"[Practical Vim](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Vim-Edit-Speed-Thought/dp/1680501275)" is a great book to learn vim.

## Mastering Html

So here is how we are going to learn frontend. We will not try to memorize every tag there is. We are going to chunk them into sort of modules. So we will memorize 
sidebars, navbars main body, footer and what not. Then we will map html tags to stylesheets. So they go hand in hand.

Here are some tips.

1. Go and viewsource a lot of websites and see how their htmls are strucured
2. Do not get into holy wars of this way that way. There are millions of ways to skin a cat.

So [let's learn]().
