## Pre-requisites and my babblings

At some point of my career, I got lazy. And others too. Whenever there is a new project kickoff meeting, I hear people blurting out 'let's just use bootstrap!', 'let's just use reactjs!', 'let's use angularjs!' 

That mentality is why you are stuck at where you are and that why I am stuck at where I am. After spending years reading books on all kind of stuff, I came to realize only "mastery" can truly set me free.

And using `bootstrap` will not set you free. By doing that you are turning yourself into an average cog who can easily be replaced; after all, anyone can build a website with `bootstrap`

To have a logevity in software industry, you need to master your craft. I am tired of being mediocre. I am at a stage where everything seems within a reach, but not quite there. So here I am starting this tutorial.

Yep. It's mostly for me. This is how I spend my `me` time when I wake up early in the morning. I get up, sneak out of bed. But I always wake my dog up. Cooper and I come down to my study, I wake my computer up then I start typing.

Deciding to start this github project was one of the best ideas that I had. Now I have a goal. No distractions. Just type and learn. Keeping moving ahead.

If you are here to get into web programming, here are some things I learned.

##### 1. Programming is not that hard.

Some programmers even claim that you are born with programming gift. I roll my eyes when I read a story starting with "When I was 5 years old, my Dad got me amiga blah blah...I've been programming since..."

Making it into NFL is hard. Making it into Major league is hard. That you have to be born with some natural talent. Not so much in programming. It can be learned and mastered for most people.

So do not let these type of people scare you away.

##### 2. Most Programming jobs are shitty and web developer(ui) jobs are even shitter.

There are a lot of programming jobs are out there. But most of them are unfortunately shitty. In one book I read, it said `your job is NOT your job, it's to find a better job`

There is no loyalty coming from your employer. So I suggest you to always look for better opportunity.

Unlike backend engineer, everybody can see your `work` if you are a web developer. And everyone start chiming in what color font should be, how big the box should be. So be prepare to deal with this `bike shed` problem.

##### 3. People skill matters a lot more than you think.

Likeability can take you further. Let's admit it. Some people are born with it. If you are not that likeable, the more reason to master your craft.

##### 4. We are not curing cancer here. Take it easy.

Go home at 5 and spend your time with your family. I have two kids and they grow up fast. Get your priority straight.

##### 4. We are not curing cancer here. Take it easy.

No. The sky is not falling. Nobody is dying because your form doesn't work correctly. Take a deep breath. If all the doctors disappear today, the world is in trouble. If all the web developers disappear today, the world will be still here. Educate your project managers and your stake holders and keep reminding them that we are not curing cancer here.

##### 5. Memorization is nothing to be ashamed of.

Unlike most folks these days, I am a huge believer in "memorizing as much as possible." What's cooler when people come to your desk with a question? You googling the answer or you answering it without googling? Which scenario do you think people would walk away thinking you know your stuff?

If you don't save anything in your head, are you really a smart person? For me, memorizing means I am planting seeds in my brain. And those seeds grow and grow. And I can think about those while I am walking my dog or driving to work. I can go through html tags from top to bottom. I can design a page in my head putting tags together in my head. Then it snowballs. Then ideas come. It's possible because I have things in my head.

There is a great book called "[The Memory Book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0345410025)." You should read it. It tells you all kind of tricks on how to memorize.

<a name="keyboard" />

## Mastering Your Keyboard

I've been sitting in front of computer for years, but never really tried to improve my typing skills. If you are like me, you can type alphabets with no problem,
but when it gets to typing in numbers or werid symbols or single/double quotation marks, you have to look at the keyboard. I want you to master touchtyping. It's
one less thing to worry about when you are in the zone. Worrying about keys quickly gets you out of the zone. And there are some good sites to help you do that.

Just a couple of tips.

1. Never use multiple fingers to push the same key.
2. Always use the opposite side `shift` key for uppercases.
3. This is how I memorize number keys and symbols on top. `1 looks like ! 2 kinda looks like @ 3 pounds is equivalent 4 dollars which is equivalent to 5 percent and 6 is wearing a hat(^) 7 and(&) snowing(*) is falling on snowman(8)'s head`
4. Buy a good mechanical keyboard and carry that around with you, so that your fingers get comfortable with the keyboard.

<a name="editor" />

## Mastering Your Editor(Vim)

I encourge you to learn vim. Why that ancient thinig? Because it's the best editor that's packaged into any unix based cloud instance you will spin up. Currently
my vim level is a baby level. But I am working on improving it. And mastery of vim has prerequisite of mastering touch typing.

Learning vi is like learning a new language. The more I learn vim, the more I am awed by it. Such a beautifully designed piece of software.

"[Practical Vim](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Vim-Edit-Speed-Thought/dp/1680501275)" is a great book to learn vim.

<a name="html" />

## Mastering Html

So here is how we are going to learn frontend. We will not try to memorize every tag there is. We are going to chunk them into sort of modules. So we will memorize 
sidebars, navbars main body, footer and what not. Then we will map html tags to stylesheets. So they go hand in hand.

Here are some tips.

1. Go and viewsource a lot of websites and see how their htmls are strucured
2. Do not get into holy wars of this way that way. There are millions of ways to skin a cat.
3. Always design with responsive in mind. "But this internal web app will never be used on a mobile phone. I get it. But thinking in responsive design forces you to think hard about your design. And forces you to have simpler design. The Simpler The Better.

So [let's learn](https://github.com/duk/FrontendLessons/tree/master/html#html-lessons).

## Mastering CSS

When you start builing a website. Ask these questions.

1. Do I need to use CSS? Always to better to use out-of-box html elements as they are. I've been some hideous web design sorcery using `<div>` as checkbox because the business wanted certain look and feel that `<intput type="checkbox">` could not handle. Do **NOT** do that.
2. Keep the styling to the minimum.
3. Understand [specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity). The idea is simple. The more specific styling scope trumps less specific styling scope.

Here we will study a few popular CSS frameworks. We will go through line by line and truly understand what is happening and how each line affects styling.

So [let's learn](https://github.com/duk/Frontend-Lessons/tree/master/css#mastering-css).

0. [Learn from Skeleton](https://github.com/duk/Frontend-Lessons/tree/master/css#skeleton)

<a name="javascript" />

## Mastering JavaScript

My favorite JavaScript books

1. [Eloquent JavaScript](https://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-JavaScript-Modern-Introduction-Programming/dp/1593275846)
2. [Functional JavaScript](https://www.amazon.com/Functional-JavaScript-Introducing-Programming-Underscore-js/dp/1449360726)
3. [Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja](https://www.amazon.com/Secrets-JavaScript-Ninja-John-Resig/dp/1617292850/)
4. [JavaScript Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Patterns-Better-Applications-Coding/dp/0596806752)

Once you are comfortable with JavaScript, you should look into [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/tutorial.html).
