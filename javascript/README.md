# Mastering JavaScript

JavaScript is the coolest language as of 2017. Nothing comes close to it. With the emergence of Node.js, and its popularity is just getting better. In 'JavaScript' section, the same rule applies. We will go through line by line of famouse frameworks and will try to understand what each line does. I get that some might be too cryptic for us to grok it. It's okay. But we will try to get most of them. 

We are trying to become a master, not a mere consumer of libraries. As we go through all these libraries and frameworks, I will discuss on important JavaScript topics.
