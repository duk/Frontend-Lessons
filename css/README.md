# Mastering CSS

First, go through some of awesome websites on your own. The biggest hurdle in CSS for me is to grok `positionining`. I found 
[Learn CSS Positioning in Ten Steps](http://www.barelyfitz.com/screencast/html-training/css/positioning/) very helpful.

And I also find this [w3schools.com How TO](http://www.w3schools.com/howto/default.asp) great for breaking a site into modules.
